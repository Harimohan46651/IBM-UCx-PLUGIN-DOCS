# Snyk

- The Snyk plug-in scans Github, GitLab, or Bitbucket repositories and pulls security alerts into UrbanCode Velocity. This vulnerability information is available as various metrics and charts in the metrics bar and dashboard. In addition, you can leverage these values in your pipeline for automated gates and deployments.
- The Snyk plug-in works with existing GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket plug-in to scan and link against known repositories. It's recommended to install and configure the existing GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket plug-in before you install the Snyk plug-in.
- Snyk scan should be performed on the repositories and should have separate projects. Automated pull requests generated by Snyk will be also visible in the Value Stream .
