# Urbancode Deploy

UrbanCode Deploy is engineered to handle the most complex deployment situations with push-button automation and controlled auditing needed in production. UrbanCode Deploy automates application deployments across varying IT environments.

The Deploy Plugin for UrbanCode Velocity imports deployment data from UrbanCode Deploy into UrbanCode Velocity. Applications in UrbanCode Deploy can be mapped in the UrbanCode Velocity pipeline and the application versions can be tracked from the pipeline.
