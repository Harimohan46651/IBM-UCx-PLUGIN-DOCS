# Jira - Overview

## Overview

The Jira plug-in provides for integration with a Jira server. This plug-in imports Jira issues and saves them as UrbanCode Velocity issues. Data between the Jira server and the UrbanCode Velocity server is synchronized every five minutes.

## Compatibility

Must be running UrbanCode Velocity version 1.2.1 and later to use the plug-in.

## Upgrade notes

Beginning with UrbanCode Velocity version 2.4.0 users must enter a user access key is required to connect with the UrbanCode Velocity server. If you are upgrading from a previous version, you must obtain and add the key to the UrbanCode Velocity configuration property. If the user access key is not added, the integration fails. A proper JQL query must be provided while integration.

## Versions

UrbanCode Velocity plug-in images are located in DockerHub. To view available versions, see the [UrbanCode DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/urbancode/ucv-ext-jira/tags).
